# Robot-Car
Designed, assembled, and coded a small robot car to drive along a track while turning right, left, and around using Arduino.

The code contains various turning and driving functions, as well as a PID controller for enhanced accuracy. Magnetic encoders attached to the wheels were used to calculate and track the angle of rotation of the car. Pictures will be attached
